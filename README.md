# EMI
Data and scripts used for Using Machine Learning to Predict Optimal Electromagnetic Induction Instrument Configurations for Characterizing the Root Zone


EMI design for GUI - with Restrictions.py - Runs the cumulative sensitivity model through EMagPy and saves the output (EMImatrix.csv). Then Runs the machine learning code on the model output and saves the following: True and predicted values for each repeat/target, RÂ² and RMSE for both training and testing, mean parameter values, mean feature importance.

Each subfolder is dedicated to one or more figures from the manuscript. With each containing the data and code that generates the figure.
